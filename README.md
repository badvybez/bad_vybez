# Project Title

A concise, one-line description of your HTML page's purpose.

## Description

Provide a more detailed explanation of what your HTML page is, what it does, and why it was created. Include any key features or functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites or dependencies required to view or interact with the HTML page, such as a specific browser version or internet connection.

### Installation

If there are any specific steps to "install" or prepare the page for viewing (e.g., cloning a repository, extracting a zip file), outline them here. For a simple HTML page, this might just involve opening the `index.html` file in a browser.

```shell
# Example: If hosted on GitHub Pages, just navigate to the URL.
# If local, you might instruct:
# 1. Download the project files.
# 2. Open 'index.html' in your preferred web browser.
